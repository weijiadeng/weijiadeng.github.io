                        <p>The Caffe Simple Inferencer is a deep learning framework used to deal with neural network inference tasks. The major goal of this project is to provide a legible calculation tool which can be configured easily. In order to achieve
                            this goal, the main part of this project uses no external library except the STL. In addition, the source data, the weight data, the output data and even the intermediate results are all represented in a human readable and
                            edible way.</p>

                        <p>The main calculation part of this project is written in a C-like style, so that it can be converted into a pure C program easily.</p>

                        <p>The file format of the nerual network information used by this program is the prototxt file which is also used by caffe, and an folder of converted caffemodel files. These files are in text format and the weight data of a single
                            layer uses its unique file, so that you can check and modify the weight data with ease. These converted caffemodel files can be converted from a caffemodel file using the caffemodel converter offered in this project.</p>

                        <p>The input image file is also in text foramt. The image file can be generated by the image converter offered by the project from a jpeg file. The image converter offers the subtract mean function and would convert RGB image to BGR
                            image which is default image mode for most caffemodels. Yet it does not support rescale of the image, so before the conversion, you need to resize the image file to the size that exactly required by the prototxt file.</p>

                        <p>This program compile Jack files (a simple, Java-like object-based language) into VM code. The resulting VM code can be run on the VM Emulator provided by the nand2tetris project. The detailed information about Jack language and
                            VM Emulator can be found in this website: https://www.nand2tetris.org/
                        </p>

                        <p>This software first extracts and stores independent comment lines, then it parse the remaining input clauses and comments into tokens using the class JackTokenizer. Then the compilation will analyse the tokens and call the VMWriter
                            class to write compiled VM code.</p>

                        <p>In addition to official specification of Jack language, this compiler also supports the correct order of arithmetic. It will compute a+bc+d as a+(bc)+d, while the official compiler would compute the result as (a+b)*c+d</p>
