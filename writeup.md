## What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?

I found the most challenging piece of this assignment is to arrange the layout of the page, especially when the layout is complicated. I have to use three or four level nested grid/flex, and each level there could be influence from the parent class. Also different web browser handle nested divs differently, which makes it even harder. I think it's quite interesting working with CSS, essentially we can treat CSS class as functions and reuse them easily. But working with HTML is quite boring, we have to mannually copy similar parts, instead of letting a function handle this. This assignment takes me about 60 hours.
## What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

1. I adjust the navbar. For the desktop mode and the mobile mode I have two kinds of navbar, in the mobile mode I use hanburger menu. I use CSS to achieve this, by setting display:none to hide unused navbar.
2. I change the layout of the page. In mobile mode, the gap is smaller, and some icons and texts that are in the same line in desktop mode are in separate lines in mobile mode.
3. I make the fonts and icons smaller.

## What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
### Below are the considerations of my design:

1. About the color of the website, I mainly use monotone color design, and aliceblue as the base color. This is because that I looked at various website and found using color with low saturation can make the website looks more modern. Also the background color should not be white, but a color with ultra low saturation.
2. I use a glass-style navbar, because I think this can make my website look cooler. 
3. I use the linkedin style design, and try to insert as many photo as possible. A few icons and photos will make the website more professional.

### I am proud of my website in the following aspects:
1. The glass effect navbar using pure CSS.
2. Hamburger menu for mobile mode.
3. Build a basic framework, new pages can be added using the same style easily.
4. All sections are expandable and foldable.
5. Snowing effect in the favorite picture section.

## Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
1. Make the snowing effect better. Currently there's no randomness in the direction the snow falls.
2. Improve the layout in the contact me section, currently lots of white space is left.
3. Improve the way of writing htmls, especially when the layout is complex. Current this nested grid in nested grid way is hard to imagine and easy to make mistakes.

## How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent about 60 hours. Half of the hours are spent in the layout design, especialy for some complex structure I have to modify them in pixel level. Graphic effects, on the contrary, are easy to implement, I spent like 10 hours on them, the most hard part is to have an idea implementing them.
