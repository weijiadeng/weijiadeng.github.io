            <p>She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted
                that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and
                go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So,
                here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.</p>
            <p>Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The
                warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually
                happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until
                it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.</p>
            <p>It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There
                had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was
                once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue
                her dream? Dana rose and took her first step.</p>
            <p>There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought
                adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the
                excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had
                come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.</p>
            <p>He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind
                that showed the wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian
                pyramids. Thereâ€™s Stonehenge. But he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply
                didn't make any sense and he wondered how he was ever going to be able to explain it.</p>
            <p>Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around
                him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew
                that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to be enough.</p>
            <p>His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to them since they refused to believe
                the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his
                imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where
                the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn't help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the
                chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it's the first moment of the day that catches you off guard. That's what Wendy was thinking.
                She opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the street. While this wasn't something
                completely unheard of, it also wasn't normal. It was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day.
                She could feel it in her bones and it wasn't the way she wanted the day to begin.</p>
            <p>It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had
                learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get
                outside and prepare.</p>
            <p>Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There
                is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in
                these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He
                says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to
                lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the
                tendency. So I try.</p>
            <p>It seemed like it should have been so simple. There was nothing inherently difficult with getting the
                project done. It was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to
                complete it on time, but that wasn't the case. The deadline had arrived and the project remained
                unfinished.</p>
            <p>Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the
                depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a
                certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging.
            </p>
            <p>Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a
                child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the
                latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long
                and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come
                with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.</p>
            <p>I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this
                moment. The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and
                is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph
                because it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the
                distraction.</p>
            <p>The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated
                it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the
                red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.</p>
            <p>The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it
                didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview
                mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from
                the cab. The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but
                she was late and didn't have a choice.</p>
            <p>It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many
                times he became confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell whether he held the
                sheep right side up, or upside down. But that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal
                itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of
                anger and disgust.</p>
            <p>What have you noticed today? I noticed that if you outline the eyes, nose, and mouth on your face with
                your finger, you make an "I" which makes perfect sense, but is something I never noticed before. What
                have you noticed today?</p>
            <p>She never liked cleaning the sink. It was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly. It
                seemed that she was forced to clean it every other day. Even when she was extra careful to keep things
                clean and orderly, it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days. What she didn't know was
                there was a tiny creature living in it that didn't like things neat.</p>
            <p>The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom yelling in the
                background, but couldn't make out exactly what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put
                them on. She knew her mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could pretend that she hadn't
                heard any of the previous yelling.</p>
